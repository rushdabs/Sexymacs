* Rice 
üçö is what makes Sexymacs sexy. Here are the ingredients:

** The Doom modeline
Everything else sucks.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package doom-modeline
  :init
  (doom-modeline-mode 1)
  :custom
  (doom-modeline-height 35))
#+END_SRC

** Doom themes
Yes, this is the exact System Crafters setup. But I'll upgrade in the future.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package doom-themes
  :config
  (load-theme 'doom-dracula t))
#+END_SRC

** Font 
Fira Code is obviously the best.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Fira Code" :height 130)
#+END_SRC

* Useful settings  
Adding some stuff to improve my workflow.
** Removing noise  
Disabling some bullshit Emacs enables by default.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(setq inhibit-startup-message t) 
(scroll-bar-mode -1) 
(menu-bar-mode -1) 
(tool-bar-mode -1) 
(tooltip-mode -1) 
#+END_SRC 

** Using the visible bell  
The bell is really annoying but the visual bell can be useful. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(setq visible-bell t) 
#+END_SRC 

** Enabling line numbers 
It is very clear that you cannot use a text editor (operating system in this case) without line numbers. 
And relative line numbers are a must. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(column-number-mode t) 
(display-line-numbers-mode t) 
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative) 
(global-display-line-numbers-mode t) 
#+END_SRC 

** Disabling line numbers on some buffers 
Obviously, you wouldn't want your shell window to be numbered. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(dolist (mode '(term-mode-hook 
                shell-mode-hook 
                eshell-mode-hook)) 
(add-hook mode (lambda () (display-line-numbers-mode 0))))
#+END_SRC

* General tools
** Ivy and Counsel
Ivy gives some really cool autocomplete and fuzzy searching features.
Swiper replaces I-search with better fuzzy searching.
And counsel replaces some emacs builtins with cooler stuff I don't remember.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ivy
  :diminish
  :bind (("C-j" . ivy-next-line-or-history)
         ("C-k" . ivy-previous-line-or-history)
         ("C-s" . swiper))
  :config
  (ivy-mode 1))

(use-package counsel
  :bind (("M-x" . counsel-M-x)
	     ("C-x b" . counsel-ibuffer)
	     ("C-x f" . counsel-find-file))
  :config
  (setq ivy-initial-inputs-alist nil))
#+END_SRC

*** Make Ivy better
Ivy-rich makes ivy better. Didn't customize too much but still does the job.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ivy-rich
  :init
  (ivy-rich-mode 1))
#+END_SRC
** Evil Mode
Obviously, you can't live with Emacs' normal keybinds without severely damaging your fingers.
So there's evil-mode, a sane way to use a text editor.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package evil
  :diminish
  :config
  (evil-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

** Which-key 
I can't remember all the keybinds so I use this package.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package which-key
  :init
  (which-key-mode)
  :diminish which-key-mode
  :config
  (setq which-key-idle-delay 0))
#+END_SRC

** Helpful
Replaces the default Emacs help buffer with a much better one.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package helpful
  :custom
  (counsel-describe-function-function #'helpful-callable)
  (counsel-describe-variable-function #'helpful-variable)
  :bind
  ([remap describe-function] . counsel-describe-function)
  ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
  ([remap describe-variable] . counsel-describe-variable)
  ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key))
#+END_SRC

** Rainbow Delimiters
I don't want to count the number of opening and closing brackets and see if they're placed properly.
This package colors the opening and closing brackets for identification.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package rainbow-delimiters
  :hook (prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Coding
** Completion
*** Frontend: Company
Company is probably the best completion frontend. Everyone uses it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package company
  :init
  (company-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

** Checking 
*** Flycheck
Pretty good syntax and warning checking with zero config.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package flycheck
  :init
  (global-flycheck-mode))
#+END_SRC 

* Git Integration 
I just use magit. It's the best. 
Except it doesn't have the git rm function. I hope they add it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package magit
  :custom
  (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1))
#+END_SRC

* Org mode
Org mode is really powerful, I love it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package org
  :config
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-indent-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Org bullets
Too many asterisks suck. Bullets here to replace them.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package org-bullets
  :after org
  :hook (org-mode . org-bullets-mode))
#+END_SRC
